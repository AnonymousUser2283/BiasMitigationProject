# BiasMitigationProject

This repository contains the code for the research illustrated in the paper 'Addressing Bias and Data Scarcity in AI-Based Skin Disease Diagnosis with
Non-Dermoscopic Images'. The aim of this project is to assess and mitigate bias in the classification of nine skin diseases by augmenting the dataset with synthetic images created via Stable Diffusion fine-tuned with DreamBooth. Please note that:

- the fine-tuning script is taken from the original library Diffusers
- the original dataset, as well as the generated images, are not available as they are considered personal data.
